# VIA Keymap Configuration

VIA is a great way to graphically configure your keyboard without going through the hassle of configuring build environments and poking around in the code.

## Install VIA

To use VIA, first [download and install](https://caniusevia.com/) the configuration software, and then plug in your keyboard. It should detect and show a graphic of Hub16 on your screen.

**Note: As of October 2020 Hub16 ships with VIA by default, however if you have an earlier version of the board, or have flashed a custom firmware on it you will need to ensure a VIA compatible keymap is on your board before continuing.**

## Configure Keys

From within VIA, you can easily configure keys as required. It allows not only the typical keys found on your keyboard, but media keys, macros, layer shifting to enable different functions per key, and even keys to control the LEDs installed in Hub16. It does not however allow you to configure the rotary encoder behaviour.

## Configure Encoders

By default, the encoders are configured to volume up / down (left) and media next / prev (right).

Unfortunately, due to limitations in VIA the encoders are not visible or configurable. The best workaround at this time is to build a new VIA keymap with the encoder functions altered to suit your use case, flash this onto the board, and then configure the remainder of the keys in VIA. This can be done by following the below instructions:

- Follow the QMK [getting started guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started) to install the toolchain and configure your build environment.
- Open the `qmk_firmware/keyboards/Hub16/keymaps/via/keymap.c` file in your preferred text editor.
- Locate the function `encoder_update_user`, and update the keycodes in `tap_code(KC_xxx)` to one from the [keycodes list](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/keycodes?id=basic-keycodes). If you use keycode not on the basic list, you may need to replace `tap_code` with `tap_code16`.
- With the changes made, save your new keymap, build, and flash the keymap to Hub16 with `make hub16:via:flash` run from the `qmk_firmware` directory.
- You should now see the encoders functioning as desired, and you can configure the remainder or your keyboard using VIA.
