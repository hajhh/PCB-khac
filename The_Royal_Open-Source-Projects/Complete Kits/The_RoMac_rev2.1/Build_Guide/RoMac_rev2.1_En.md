## *Soldering Required* - Tools Needed:

| Tool | Notes |
| ---- | ---- |
| Soldering Iron | Variable Temp is recommended.  Makes Soldering easier, and prevents "PCB Burn" |
| Brass Wool | Keeps your Iron Clean and Well Functioning.  Also produces cleaner & easier soldering job visually |
| Thin solder | Thinner Solder Keeps "Solder Gobs" at a minumum (1mm diameter 60/40 Is What I used) |
| Small Electronics Screw Driver (Phillips-Head) | Used for Standoff/Spacer Screws |
| Flush Cutters | Cleans up your Diode Leads more so than other methods |
| [3D Printed Diode Bender](https://github.com/TheRoyalSweatshirt/The_RoMac_rev2.1/blob/master/3D%20Printing%20Stuff/Keyboard%20Diode%20Bender%20V2.stl) | Makes Bending Diode Leads Super Easy and More uniform |
