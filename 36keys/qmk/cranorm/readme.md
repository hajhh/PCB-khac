# Crab Keyboards

Split keyboards with 3x5 vertically staggered keys and 3 thumb keys, based very heavily on the corne-light by [foostan](https://github.com/foostan/) [@foostan](https://twitter.com/foostan)  

You can still use the crkbd firmware instead of this if you want more 'features' as long as you have a keymap for 36 keys. 

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

make cranorm:default

or 

make cranorm:default:avrdude
