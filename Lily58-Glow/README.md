# Lily58 × qtkb Glow
Lily58 is 6×4+4keys column-staggered split keyboard. 

I changed the SK6812MINI LED to SK6812MINI-E in the positions of the switch to make it easy to solder by hand.
And I also added the USB Type c port as the 2-way connector (you can still use the TRRS jack if you want), and encoder.
