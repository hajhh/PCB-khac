There is an unused position in the matrix.

As of V1.02, this empty position has been made accessible on the PCB.

Install D28 and handwire the additional switch to the 2 pin header located near the thumb cluster.


This extra key allows a modification to the keyboard similar to this [one](https://imgur.com/a/Vr0oH#H5ut7ZZ) on the Iris.
