## Option 2: 1x 2U and 2x 1U Thumb Keys
With this option the 2U key will be on the left or right with the 2x 1U keys on  the other side.
Note that some Planck Keycap kits will not have enough 1U keys to support this layout.  The 4 1U macro keys on the inner columns may be left out.

## Option 3: 4x 1U Thumb Keys
With this option, you will only use 1U keys and will not require stabilizers. 
Note that many of the Planck Keycap kits will not have enough 1U keys to support this layout.  Only the larger kits may be able to support this layout.
