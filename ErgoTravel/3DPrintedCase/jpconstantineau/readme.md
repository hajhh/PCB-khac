To Do:

Design of a 3D printed Case in 4 parts

Top/Bottom Left
Top/Bottom Right

Similar design to Let's Split Case [on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2626039)

- It's angled 
- It's very close to the size of the PCB
- The back of the case protects the connectors.

Ideally generated with OpenScad (to make the design open source using free tools - just like the PCB)

Production Files to be stored in STL folder once completed so that people don't need to "compile" the design into a file that can be produced.

Note: dxf files are for reference. The orientation of the 1U thumb switches are not right
