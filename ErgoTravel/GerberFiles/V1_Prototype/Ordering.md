## Instructions on how to order these gerber files

Go to [AllPCB](https://www.allpcb.com/online_quote.html?hidLength=&hidWidth=&num=&txtSelNum=&Layersquote=2&Thicknessquote=1.6), [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/quote) or [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/order) and order the PCBs with the parameters shown below.
For a more comprehensive list of places where you can have the PCB manufactured, go to [PCBShopper](https://pcbshopper.com/).
